# Song's Popularity Classification
## Project Manager: Iana Mae Peralta
## Team: Rinrada Maneenop, Alfredo, Elianna
Created a classifier that predicts whether or not a song will be popular using training and testing dataset from Kaggle through data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and data visualizations.
Each team member implemented different models and compared the results of our models:
  1. Rinrada Maneenop's Model: Random Forest
  2. Alfredo Mendiola's Model: XGBoost
  3. Elianna Garcia's Model : Neural Networks
